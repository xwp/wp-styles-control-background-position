Extension for Styles plugin to add a background-position control type

== Description ==

This is a plugin/extension for the [Styles plugin](http://stylesplugin.com/). It adds a new `background-position` control type
which can be referenced by that ID in the `type` field of the control defined in your customize.json. It allows you to specify
the X and Y coordinates separately, allowing lengths of any unit, as well as keywords.

== Screenshots ==

1. Set pixel X and Y coordinates
2. Use keyword positions for X and Y coordinates
3. Use a pixel value and a keyword value for either dimension
4. Change unit from pixel to percentage and other CSS units
